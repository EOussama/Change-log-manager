## Description
It’s always nice to have a lightweight tool to help you out with your daily-development activities while working on different projects, I found myself stating the changes I make on my projects on different *.txt files, in plain format, it was only a matter of time, till those dozens of files started to stack on each other, making it harder for me to find and/or review them later, I had this tool by my side for quite a while, served its purpose the way I wanted, and here I am sharing it here for anyone who’s interested in either improving it or using it.

## Features
The application is still far from perfect, or maybe not?! both in design and functionality, but with suggestions, it can be improved. You can easily create, open or save your changelogs under a *.log file, you can also export the change-log under HTML, *.txt, markdown, BBCode or pawn syntax format. all of your recent opened change-logs are saved under a file that's automatically created, called “config.cfg”.
- [X] Export in many formats (BBCode, Markdown, plain text, HTML, Pawn snippets)
- [X] Template saving.
- [X] Quick open recent files.
- [X] Quick edit/delete/manage/move entries.

> **Note**: upon using this tool, you'll notice a file called `config.cfg` create, do not delete it unless you want to reset all your recently opened files.
